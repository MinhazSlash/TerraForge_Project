TerraForge is a C++ based computer graphics project developed using the raylib library. The
project simulates an interactive 3D environment featuring procedural terrain generation, real-time
camera movement, environmental effects such as rain and fog, dynamic tide level control, and
day-night lighting transitions.
Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To implement a real-time 3D graphics scene using OpenGL through raylib
- To demonstrate terrain generation and environmental animation
- To apply camera transformations and shader-based rendering
- To simulate realistic environmental effects
- To practice collaborative development using Git and GitHub
Key Features
- Day, evening, and night lighting cycle
- Fog on and off toggle
- Rain on and off toggle
- 360 degree free camera movement
- Dynamic tide level rising and falling
- Shader-based lighting effects
Technologies Used
